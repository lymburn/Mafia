# Mafia
iOS app for the popular party game Mafia with additional features. The app is in collaboration with a teammate who is working
on the backend and web version. Mafia utilizes tools such as Socket.IO and HTTP requests to communicate between the app and server.
It also uses UIKit to create an engaging game UI as well as the MVVM architecture pattern to reduce controllers' size, improve
separation of concern, and allow better testability.
